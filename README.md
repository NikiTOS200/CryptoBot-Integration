# CryptoBot-Integration
You can look at the implementation of CryptoBot integration for payment and rewrite it for yourself. But you won't find any detailed instructions.

To use it, insert your API keys.
And also in the RCTZ.py:

```pythonfile 
self.__base_url = "https://testnet-pay.crypt.bot/api /" #https://pay.crypt.bot/api/
```

Choose which network you are working on "testnet" (Any transaction in this network is not valid) or in the regular network (the regular network is also in the commented line).
